## This is the introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Howdy,

I’m a creative techie. For fun, I create alternative keyboard layouts and write fiction. For work, I craft technical documentation and Audit SEO efficacy. 

***I wrote this page in GitHub flavored Markdown. To downlaod or *git clone* examples of my work, check out the [Writing Samples](#writing-samples)

## Style <a name="paragraph1"></a>
I work with diverse teams in creating direction for marketing campaigns and designing technical writing/API documentation. 

I write/copywrite, primarily, in a Classic style but use Plain and Meta as well. And, hope to bring a sense of style to technical writing. This is my passion and something unique that I bring to the table, no more should readers say “this reads like stereo instructions.” Most often, I write long form content. I make engaging short form content too. Here is a brief excerpt from a 500 word article:

On average, Ransomware costs Hackers between 250 dollars and 650 dollars. 	It’s hard to believe, but malicious software costs less 	than a jalopy, and, this metaphorical second-hand car takes 	Ne'er-do-wells further than the corner-store. For their 	flyspeck 	investment, cyber-criminals hijack data for 	millions of dollars! In fact, bargain-bin saboteur software 	has become the norm.

#My Work <a name="paragraph1"></a>
I work well with the limitations of Twitter and can customize a post for both long form blogs, like Medium, and quick reads like Facebook. I am adept at Adobe Experience Manager, when it comes to modifying and managing content. In fact, I quickly gathered followers for the trekking industry in Nepal, via Twitter, and a psychologist in India, In Vivo by writing multi-panel blogs for their website as well as longer content. Working closely with UI/UX, I’ve created content for players in big data as well the liberal arts, not to brag. 




## My Skills <a name="paragraph3"></a>

It goes without saying that SEO is on the menu when I’m the chef. Currently, I’m working on a technical analysis for S9.

When it comes to structuring content, DITA, ConTeXt and DocBook are all at my command. The Darwin Information Typing Architecture really is great for social media and technical documents. Writing each paragraph with a conref link, paragraphs, or portions of, can be reused and reassembled in new ways to create long and short content. I aslo organize data in lesser known systems like EAD3. Working with It and UX, I can plan for the whole lifecycle of content.

<summary><font color=black><b>My Speciality</b></font>
</summary>
<p>


I'm a center-brained writer and specialize in metalanguages like: 

- XML
- Docbook
- DITA
- Markdown

And typsetting languages like:

- LaTeX
- LuaTex

</p>
</details>


I also work with shell languages like Bash and meta languages such as XML, pure XML, not just DITA and DocBook. As of now, I'm writing a universal playlist maker in Bash and .XSPF. Since much of what we do nowadays is from a Linux server, these skills come in handy. 

When it comes to databases, I know SQL. So, if blogs or portions of blogs are saved as a database entry, as they sometimes are, I readily use SELECT, FROM and WHERE. Also, I can use database management tools by Oracle. 

### Conclusion <a name="subparagraph1"></a>

All things considered, I write engaging technical documentation for complex API’s, social media posts, both long and short, for startups and established brands. I know how to increase reach, time on page, guide CTR and improve sales. Through writing, I modify Click-through-Rate and get those likes, or whatever KPI’s you’d like to hit.  Working with editors and the IT team, I can make your social media sail! So, here’s my call to action, hire me today and improve engagement. All-in-all, my goal is to make technical writing more engaging.
